        <h2> Training for muscular endurance</h2>
        <p> 
            When training to improve muscular endurance, what matters most is not the type of exercise, but how people design their workout.

                People should take into consideration the following when tailoring a workout to boost muscular endurance:
                <li>the number of reps</li>
                <li>the weight or resistant force on the muscles</li>
                </i>the number of sets</li>
                <li>length or rest periods</li>
                </ul>
                According to the National Strength and Conditioning Association, individuals training for muscular endurance should aim to complete three or more sets of 15 or more exercise reps with a load that is 50% or less of their one rep max (RM).
