            <h3>Dilated cardiomyopathy</h3>
           <div id="main">
        <p>
            In dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart chambers become dilated, meaning that the heart muscle stretches and becomes thinner. The most common causes of dilated cardiomyopathy are prior heart attacks, arrhythmias, and toxins.

            As a result, the heart becomes weaker and cannot pump blood properly. It can result in arrhythmia, blood clots in the heart, and heart failure.
