    <li>Antiplatelet therapies: These include aspirin, and they can also prevent clots.</li>
    <li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: These can help treat heart failure and high blood pressure by causing the blood vessels to expand. Benazepril (Lotensin) is one example.</li>

    <li>Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors: These can help open up narrowed arteries to treat heart failure.</li>
    <li>Beta-blockers: Atenolol (Tenormin) and other medications in this class can reduce the heart rate and lower blood pressure. They can also treat arrhythmias and angina.</li>
    <li>Calcium channel blockers: These can lower blood pressure and prevent arrhythmias by reducing the pumping strength of the heart and relaxing the blood vessels. One example is diltiazem (Cardizem).</li>
