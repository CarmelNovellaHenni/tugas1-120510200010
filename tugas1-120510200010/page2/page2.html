          <h2> Types of heart disease</h2>
            <p>There are several different types of heart disease, and they affect the heart in different ways.

            The sections below will look at some different types of heart disease in more detail.</p>
            <br/>
           <h3>Coronary artery disease</h3>
           <br/>
           <div class="block">Coronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common type of heart disease.</div>
           <br/>
           <p>It develops when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged with plaque. <span>This causes them </span>to harden and narrow. Plaque contains cholesterol and other substances.</p>
           <p>As a result, the blood supply reduces, and the heart receives less oxygen and fewer nutrients. In time, the heart muscle weakens, and there is a risk of heart failure and arrhythmias. When plaque builds up in the arteries, this is called atherosclerosis.</p>
           <br/>
           <h3> Arrhythmia</h3>
           <br/>
           <div>
        <span class="sembunyi">Arrhythmia refers </span>  to an irregular heartbeat. It occurs when the electrical impulses that coordinate the heartbeat do not work properly. As a result, the heart may beat too fast, too slowly, or erratically.
           </div>
           <br/>
           <h3>Congenital heart defects</h3>
           <br/>
          <div>
        <div class="hilang">A person with a congenital heart defect</div>is born with a heart problem. There are many types of congenital heart defect, including:
          </div>
          <p> 
            <ul>
              <li>Abnormal heart valves: Valves may not open properly or may leak blood</li>
              <li> Septal defects: There is a hole in the wall between either the lower chambers or the upper chambers of the heart.</li>
              <li> Atresia: One of the heart valves is missing.</li>
            </ul>
           </p>
          <p>
          Congenital heart disease can involve major structural issues, such as the absence of a ventricle and problems with the main arteries that leave the heart.
