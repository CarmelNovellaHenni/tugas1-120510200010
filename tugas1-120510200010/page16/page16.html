                    Moderate resistance training, with short intervals in between for rest, creates short bursts of tension to build strength. Circuit or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be a suitable way to combine cardio and strength training into one workout. Unless a personâ€™s fitness goals involve training for a particular endurance-based sport, training for muscular endurance alone may not be the most appropriate strategy. The best exercise programs mix strength and muscular endurance training. Some evidence also suggests that exercise programs that people find enjoyable may be more likely to generate long-term benefits, as they may be more likely to stick with them.
