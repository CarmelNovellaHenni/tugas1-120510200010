          <h3>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</h3>
           <div class="teks">
            This condition usually develops when a genetic problem affects the heart muscle. It tends to be an inherited condition. The walls of the muscle thicken, and contractions become harder. This affects the heartâ€™s ability to take in and pump out blood. In some cases, an obstruction can occur.
