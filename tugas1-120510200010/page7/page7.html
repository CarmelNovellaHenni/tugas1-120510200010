  <h3>Mitral valve prolapse</h3>
  <p>
    This happens when the valve flaps of the mitral valve do not close properly. Instead, they bulge into the left
    atrium. This can cause a heart murmur.
  </p>
  <div class="static">
    Mitral valve prolapse is not usually life threatening, but some people may need treatment.
  </div>
  <br />
  <h4>Factors</h4>
  <div class="relative1">
    Genetic factors and connective tissue problems can cause this condition, which affects around 2% of the population.
  </div>
  <div class="relative2">
    <h3> Aortic stenosis</h3>
    <p>In aortic stenosis, the pulmonary valve is thick or fused and does not open properly. This makes it hard for the
      heart to pump blood from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery.</p>
  </div>
  <p>In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve opening is too narrow, restricting blood flow from the left ventricle to the
    aorta. It can also impact the pressure in the left atrium. A person may be born with it, or it may develop over time
    due to calcium deposits or scarring</p>

  <h3> Symptoms</h3>
  <br />
  <div class="relative">
    The symptoms of heart disease depend on the specific type a person has. Also, some heart conditions cause no
    symptoms at all.
    <div class=" absolute">
      In children, the symptoms of a congenital heart defect may include cyanosis, or a blue tinge to the skin, and an
      inability to exercise.
