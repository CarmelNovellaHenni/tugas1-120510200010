                <b>What is muscular endurance?</b>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Muscular endurance is the ability to continue contracting a muscle, or group of muscles, against resistance, such as weights or body weight, over a period of time. Increasing the performance of these muscles means they can continue to contract and work against these forces. Greater muscular endurance allows a person to complete more repetitions of an exercise, for example, pushups or squats.</p>
